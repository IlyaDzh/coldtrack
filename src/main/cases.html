                    ColdStack can help provide clients with unified data management to deal with heterogeneous data of

                    ColdStack can store and retrieve large hybrid datasets for DeFi services (like payout schedules and
                    token bonding curves). Most of this data isn't frequently accessed but must be stored for a very
                    long time or even forever.

                    ColdStack can help game developers with cheap and reliable storage for the archive data about the
                    player’s activities. It will make all the payments and rewards more transparent and auditable.
