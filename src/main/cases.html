                    ColdStack can store and retrieve large hybrid datasets for DeFi services like payout schedules and
                    token bonding curves. Most of this data isn't frequently accessed but must be stored for a very long
                    time or even forever.

                    ColdStack can help game developers with the cheap and reliable storage for the archive data about
                    the players activities. It must be stored during a long period. It will make all the payments and
                    rewards more transparent and auditable.
