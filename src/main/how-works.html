                    The main purpose of <b>ColdStack System</b> is to store and retrieve user’s data in a stack of
                    Clouds via <b>Unified Data Exchange API</b>, which is 100% compatible with Amazon S3 API. That
                    allows any project to use any AWS library or SDK and start to use our ColdStack without significant
                    integration efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially the data file goes to the Upload Node (which can issue NFT tokens for the uploaded files)
                    and then transmitted to Cloud Storage (usually Decentralized i . Users can specify the exact Storage
                    or save up to 80% of the storage cost by allowing our AI-based engine to optimize the further
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the costs are calculated at the Billing Node in <b>$CLS</b>: ColdStack ERC20 Tokens. Due to the
                    ETH high transaction price and latency, we use Polkadot infrastructure for transactional billing
                    (per each data storage / retrieval operation). Decentralized Clouds such as Filecoin and SIA are
                    charging for the data storage space in their own coins such as $FIL and $SC, so we use Decentralized
                    Exchanges <b>(DEX)</b> to supply our users with a <b>unified payment gateway</b>.
