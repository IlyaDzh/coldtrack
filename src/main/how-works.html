                    The main purpose of <b>ColdStack System</b> is to store and retrieve userâ€™s data in a stack of
                    Clouds via Unified Data Exchange API, which is 100% compatible with <b>Amazon S3 API</b>. That
                    allows any project to use any AWS library or SDK and start to use our System without significant
                    integration efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will publish an open-source library with AWS S3 compatible API to the most of Decentralized
                    Storages. Users of ColdStack Storage System will save <b>up to 80%</b> of the storage cost with our
                    AI-based pipeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ColdStack ecosystem has three types of nodes: File Node provides file upload / download services,
                    Gateway Node works directly with the Decentralized Clouds and Billing Node calculates storage costs
                    and charges the users. Due to the ETH high transaction price and latency, we use <b>Polkadot
                        parachain</b> for transactional billing (per each data storage/retrieval operation).
